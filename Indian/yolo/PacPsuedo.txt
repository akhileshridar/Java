Pacman Java Pseudocode:
	-create 5 classes
		-one of them extends JPanel, actionlistener - this will have 
		the timer as well as the paintComponent method
		-one implements keyListener and comands the pacman
		-one is as simple class which holds the cheese 
		-one is a more complicated class which controls the monsters
		-and finally one is the main class used to set up the JFrame
	
	1)Create a JFrame of size approximately 600x580. 
		paintComponent
			-use a for loop to draw the grid of gray lines using the 
			g.fillRect method
			-Draw blue rectangles around to stand for the picture 
			part of the frame
			-On the bottom use g.drawString to write the directions
	
	2)To do the animations, create 2 methods to draw the pacman 
		-make an integer which counts up on each time 
		actionPerformed is called
		-if the integer%2 is = 0, draw it using one method (drawFull())
		-if the integer%2 is = 1, draw it using the other method
												(drawIncPac());
		-each animation would occur at 5 ms.
		
	3) Pacman Class: 
		-create variables for x, y, and moveAmount- x and y
		hold the x and y positions of the object, while moveAmount
		would be the amount in pixels needed to make exactly one hop
		-randomize x, y in the constructor using Random.nextInt
			-number = offset + rand.nextInt(9)*moveAmount
		-make the class implement key listener, and in the main class 
		add the keyListener to the JFrame
		-use the KeyPressed method to check which key has been pressed
			-if a, subtract moveamount from x
			-if d, add moveamount to x
			-if w, subdract moveamount from y
			if s, add moveamount to y
		-also have a drawPacman() method that draws the pacman when
		placed inside paintComponent
		-finally have a rectangle object which surrounds the pacman
		that can be used to check intersections with the other objects
	
	4) Cheese Class 
		-create x, y which are randomly assigned in constructor
		-have a drawCheese() Method which draws the chese 
		-have a method called isEaten(Pacman p) which is able to
		check if the pacman has collided with the cheese, in which case
		the cheese disapears and toggles a boolean that says so
	
	5) Mosnter class
		-create random x ,y in constructor
		-have a method called doAction, which generates 2 random 
		numbers.
			-the first number determines whether to do anything at all
			 	-make it a very small possiblilty of doing anything
			-the 2nd number determines which directio to move:
				0 - up, 1 - down ,2 - right 3 - left
		-have a method to draw the monster
		-have a method to check if the pacman has been moved on top,
		in which case end the game
		
	6) JPanel Class: 
		-create instances of the following
			-one instance of the Pacman 
			-an array of size 6 which holds all the monsters
			-an array of size 6 which holds all the cheeses
		-in the paintcomponent, check for collisions between
		the pacman and the monsters and the chese
		-in the actionListener, animate the pacman to open and close
		the mouth
			-also implement the random actions of the monsters, so 
			as to attack the pacman
		-for the reset - have a method which resets all the integers 
		and arrays to their starting values to make it a new game
		-also create a new method called checkWinLoss, and if the 
		method returns true (it will be of type boolean) then 
		stop all activities and make a large string flash in the 
		middle of the screen with whichever happened during your
		game
