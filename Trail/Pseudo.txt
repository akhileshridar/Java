Initial Design: 
	Create a window (Jpanel)
	Initizlize 2D array
       Create keyTyped listener for input type
	
1st Refinement: 
	Draw black box in middle of JFrame
	Used keyTyped for what the user types
	After getting what user types, move the square
	Store where square is in a 2D array
	Repaint
	Decrease brightness of squares before(RGB brightness decrease)
	Loop until user closes the program

2nd Refinement:
	Draw a 5x5 black box in center of program, (250, 250)
	tf.addKeyListener(this);
	public void keyPressed (KeyEvent e) {
		char c = e.getKeyChar();
	}
	Switch case statement for changing square location

	switch [c] {
		case a {
			move left
		}
		case d {
			move right
		}
		case w {
			move up 
		}
		case x {
			move down 
		}
		case q {
			diagonal up-left
		}
		case e {
			diagonal up-right
		}
		case z {
			diagonal down-left
		} 
		case c {
			 diagonal down-right
		}
	}

	After getting movement, save new location in a 2D array
