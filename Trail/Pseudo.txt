Initial Design: 
	Create a window
	Create 5x5 black box in center
	Initizlize 2D array
       Create keyTyped listener for input type
	
1st Refinement: 
	Get keyboard input from user
	When input, draw new box to where user wants to go
	Used keyTyped for what the user types
	After getting what user types, move the square
	Repaint 
	Decrease brightness of squares (RGB brightness decrease)
	Loop until user closes the program
