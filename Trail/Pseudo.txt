Initial Design: 
	Create a window (Jpanel)
	 Initialize 2D array
        Create keyTyped listener for input type
	Initialize variables, (i.e. colorcount, xloc, yloc, etc.)
	
1st Refinement: 
	Draw black box in middle of JFrame
	Used keyTyped for what the user types
	After getting what user types, move the square
	Store where square is in a 2D array
	Repaint
	Decrease brightness of squares before(RGB brightness decrease)
	Loop until user closes the program

2nd Refinement:
	Draw black 5x5 box in middle of program
	Add in KeyListener: tf.addKeyListener
	Get key pressed, put it in a char (i.e. c) -->
	After getting user input, use a switch case statement to get move
	After getting new location, save this in the 2D array initialized in the beginning
 	(i.e. array [xloc][yloc])
	Repaint all triangles. When repainting from array, use variable colorcount to keep 	track of fading. colorcount++ each time after
	
	
	
3rd Refinement:
	Draw a 5x5 black box in center of program, (250, 250)
	tf.addKeyListener(this);
	public void keyPressed (KeyEvent e) {
		char c = e.getKeyChar();
	}
	Switch case statement for changing square location

	switch [c] {
		case a {
			move left
			break;
		}
		case d {
			move right
			break;
		}
		case w {
			move up 
			break;
		}
		case x {
			move down 
			break;
		}
		case q {
			diagonal up-left
			break;
		}
		case e {
			diagonal up-right
			break;
		}
		case z {
			diagonal down-left
			break;
		} 
		case c {
			diagonal down-right
			break;
		}
	}

	After getting movement, save new location in a 2D array
	array [locationx] [locationy] [5] [5];
	repaint(); (Do this to print out new square and old squares saved in array)
        colorcount =1;
	Use color count to repaint triangles from array
	colorcount++;
	Repeat these steps until user is done
	System.exit(1);
