Pacman Java Pseudocode
Author: Jimmy Liu

Pre-code:
	Initilize two 10x10 array 'array' and 'cheddar'
	Create variable for keeping track of cheese 'cheese'
	Timers for ghost and Pacman animation 'timer' timer2'
	KeyListner (KeyTyped)
	
Revision Three:
	1. Paint the following on the board to get started:
			- Frame Size: 500x500px
			- Blue frame around game (setBorder)
			- 10x10 grid with a 5px gray stroke around each box
			- On bottom, red background, black text, Helvetica
			
	2. Create 10x10 array 'array'. Each array would be 
	   single box on the grid. 
	   
	   	Key:
	   	1 - Empty
	   	2 - Cheese
	   	3 - Ghost
	   	4 - Pacman mouth open
	   	5 - Pacman mouth closed
	   	 
	3. Animations. Start the two timers
	   		timer.start(), timer1.start()
				timer(500, ghostmove)
				timer1(500, pacmanmouth)
				
	4. Ghost switching. Have a timer for 3s, where then the ghost
	   would then move to a new random location. Changes to array.
	   After this, check if Pacman is on the array square. If so,
	   player loses (see 6).
	   
	5. Game Logic. The following would need to be implemented:
			if (cheese)
				add +1 to cheese
					if (cheesecounter =6)
						tell player they have just won the game
			
			if (ghost)
				write to screen= "you have lost";
				
	6. Getting input from the user. Using the keylistner, we would 
      want to know where the user wants to go. This would be done 
      via a switch-case statement, with each assigned key as a 		 choice. 
      
      	switch (c): 
      		case a: move pacman to one array unit left
      		case d: move pacman to one array unit right
      		case w: move pacman to one array unit top
      		case s: move pacman to one array unit down
      	
      	Check player dead or not
      	
      	repaint()
      	
	7. Losing and winning.
				Lose - Display loss
				Win  - Display win
				
		Resetting can be when player uses the 'R' key. To reset:
				- Dump Array (nested for loop all to 1)
				- Run repaint()
