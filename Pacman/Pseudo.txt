Pacman Java PseudoCode
Author: Jimmy Liu ~ 

Pre-code:
	Initilize 10x10 array 
	
Revision One:
	1. Draw board onto the program. 10x10 frame, blue border and 	   gray stroke. Draw directions on the bottom
	2. Determine cheese location on the array. Each array would be 
	   single box on the grid. 
	   	Array System:
	   	1 - Empty
	   	2 - Cheese
	   	3 - Ghost
	   	4 - Pacman
	3. Fill in ghosts into array. Follow array system above. Timer 	   ghosts to move around automatically
	4. Draw Pacman animation. Add timer for keeping track of 	   opening and closing of the mouth of Pacman.
	5. Game logic. If timer changes array block that Pacman is 	   currently on, the player loses. If there are no more 	   cheese, the player wins. If Pacman eats one cheese, remove
	   it (use a counter to keep track of cheese eats)
