Pacman Java Pseudocode
Author: Jimmy Liu ~ http://github.com/lele0108

Pre-code:
	Initilize 10x10 array
	Create variable for keeping track of cheese
	Timers for ghost and Pacman animation
	KeyListner (KeyTyped)
	
Revision One:
	1. Draw board onto the program. 10x10 frame, blue border and 	   gray stroke. Draw directions on the bottom
	2. Determine cheese location on the array. Each array would be 
	   single box on the grid. 
	   	Array System:
	   	1 - Empty
	   	2 - Cheese
	   	3 - Ghost
	   	4 - Pacman
	3. Fill in ghosts into array. Follow array system above. Timer 	   ghosts to move around automatically
	4. Draw Pacman animation. Add timer for keeping track of 	   opening and closing of the mouth of Pacman.
	5. Game logic. If timer changes array block that Pacman is 	   currently on, the player loses. If there are no more 	   cheese, the player wins. If Pacman eats one cheese, remove
	   it (use a counter to keep track of cheese eats)
	   
Revision Two:

	1. Paint the following on the board to get started:
			Frame Size: 500x500px
			Blue frame around game
			10x10 grid with a 5px gray stroke around each box
			On bottom, red background, black text, Helvetica
	2. Create 10x10 array. Each array would be 
	   single box on the grid. 
	   	Array System:
	   	1 - Empty
	   	2 - Cheese
	   	3 - Ghost
	   	4 - Pacman
		Purpose of array would be keeping track of what each box 		is currently. First, we would fill all the array with 		default, which would be 1. Afterwords, using a random 
		generator, we would fill the cheese, ghost, and Pacman. 
	3. Animations. Pacman's animations would be drawn at 5ms. 
	   This would simulate the opening and closing of his mouth.
	4. Ghost switching. Have a timer for 3s, where then the ghost
	   would then move to a new random location. Changes to array.
	5. Game Logic. The following would need to be implemented:
			-Pacman eating cheese. Counter would start with 0, and
			 everytime Pacman eats a cheese, this counter would rise
			 until 6, where it would tell the player they have won.
			-Ghost. If Pacman is on the same array square as a ghost, 
			 then the game is over, and the player loses and does not 
			 collect $200. 
	6. Losing and winning. When player wins, display so. If player 
	   loses, display so. Using keylistner, if user presses the
	   key 'R' or "r", then it would reset the game.
